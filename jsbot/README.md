## JSBot

JSBot is an IRC bot library written in Node JS.

With features like multiple server support and being 'pretty good, I guess,' 
JSBot is designed to be the IRC bot library of the future! For an example of a
large project which uses JSBot, take a look at 
[DepressionBot](http://github.com/reality/depressionbot/ "DepressionBot").

To get started with JSBot, take a look at the 'run.js' example provided with the
code, then head on over to the 
[online documentation](https://github.com/reality/jsbot/wiki/Documentation "JSBot Docs").
