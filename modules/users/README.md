## Users

Track users.

### Description

This module tracks users and their aliases through nick changes and all that
kind of thing. It's mainly a utility module for other modules to use. 

### Commands

#### ~alias [user]
If an alias is provided, this command will return the primary user for which
this is an alias for. If a primary user is provided, it will return a
confirmation of this fact and a count of how many aliases belong to the user.

#### ~setaliasparent [newparent]
Set a nick which is currently serving as an alias to the primary user, while
setting what was previously the primary user as an alias of the new primary
user. Requires moderator level access by default.

#### ~mergeusers [primaryuser] [secondaryuser]
This command merges two nicks which are recorded as primary users into one user.
The secondary user and all of their aliases will be merged under primaryuser.
Requires moderator level access by default.

### API

was found with the given name on the given server.

#### getRandomChannelUser(server, channel, callback)
Given a server name and a channel name, this gets a random user from that
channel. Callback is called with one argument, a _user_ object or false if no
